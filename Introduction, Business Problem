    Business Project to open a coffie shop
    
    There is a opportunity to open a coffie shop in New York (Manhaten) or Toronto (Center). However there are a lot of coffie shops in these cities and we need to
    determin which places are more suitible to open up a coffie shop.
    
    Using Foursquare location data we will analyze New York and Toronto area and their venues. Then we willl cluster the data in the neighborhoods and look for the one
    neighborhood with the least coffie shops in them. Then we woud look at the reviews and look for the cluster with the badest coffie shop reviews. In this way there 
    would be less competition.
    
    There should be two seperate tables with the primary data of two cities (with coordinates, neighborhoods and venues). Once the data is clean we should cluster it and find
    the best cluster for coffie shop.
    
    Data will be collected from Wikipedia, Foursquare, csv files and IBM cloud.
